## Overview
**SmartSave** is a GDPR-compliant smart savings application designed for users in the EU, focusing on transparency, collaboration, and security.  
It combines traditional savings with AI-powered financial insights via the **SaveBuddy AI assistant**, allowing users to manage personal and group savings easily, while keeping their data private and secure.

## Architecture

### Monorepo & Modular Design
SmartSave uses a **modular architecture** within a **monorepo** setup.  
Each feature lives in its own module under the `modules/` directory, designed for separation of concerns and ease of scaling.

**Modules:**
- `auth` — authentication and authorization logic  
- `gdpr` — GDPR compliance and user data management  
- `user` — user profile and preferences  
- `wallet` — wallet creation and balance management  
- `savings` — individual and group savings  
- `notifications` — email-based user notifications  
- `shared` — reusable schemas and utilities

Each module contains:
```yaml
  repository.py # Database access layer
  models.py # Database models (except Auth module)
  schemas.py # Pydantic schemas
  service.py # Business logic
  helpers.py # Utility functions (optional)
```

### API & Infrastructure Highlights
- **Versioning:** `/v1/...` URL structure for all endpoints  
- **Docs:** Swagger & ReDoc available at `/v1/docs` (protected with Basic Auth)  
- **Rate Limiting:** `Per-minute/hour` restrictions per IP  
- **Redis:** Used for `caching` and fast data retrieval with reasonable TTLs + manual cache invalidation 
- **Logging:** Structured `JSON logs` per request, with hashed IP addresses  
- **Makefile:** Common commands for Docker, Alembic, and Pytest  
- **Scripts:** Dev and prod startup scripts in `scripts/`  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Alembic for `DB migrations`  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflows (`ci.yml`, `cd.yml`)  
- **Environment:** `.env.example` provided for configuration variables  

**Backend System Flow:**  
```bash
  Middleware → Router → Service → Repository → Database
```

## Authentication & Authorization

1. User registers with **email** and **password**.  
2. A **6-digit OTP** is sent to the user’s email for verification.  
3. Once verified, `user.is_verified` is set to `True`.  
4. On successful login, a **JWT** is issued and used for all authenticated requests.  
5. Failed logins increment `user.failed_login_attempts`; exceeding the limit locks the account.  
6. Locked accounts trigger a **notification email** to the user.  
7. Roles are defined as:
   - **USER:** Full access to own data only  
   - **ADMIN:** Limited create/read access except GDPR/user/wallet data  
   - **SUPER_ADMIN:** Full CRUD access (excluding wallet/transactions modification)  

Wallets and transactions are **immutable** - they cannot be modified or deleted once created.

---

## GDPR Compliance

SmartSave was built around the **three core GDPR principles**:
1. **Right to Access Data**  
2. **Right to Modify Data**  
3. **Right to Delete Data**

### Key Implementations
- IP addresses are stored as **irreversible hashes** in logs.  
- Users can **request a data report**, delivered as a **password-protected PDF** via email.  
- Data modification is allowed through the app or via support requests.  
- Account deletions are **soft-deleted** for 365 days before anonymization (duration is easily configurable).  
- **Anonymization Process:**
  - All PII replaced with random values.
  - User can no longer log in.
  - Maintains referential integrity for financial auditing.
- Logs older than **30 days** are auto-deleted.
- GDPR requests are logged in a dedicated `GDPRRequest` table.  
- After two years, even the anonymized GDPR requests are removed.

## Caching with Redis

To improve performance and reduce database load, we implemented **Redis caching** for frequently accessed endpoints, i.e:

- `GET /user/me`
- `GET /wallet/transactions`

### How It Works

1. **Cache Key Naming:**  
   Keys follow a consistent pattern to avoid collisions and allow easy invalidation:
   - Current user: `user_current:{user_email}`
   - Wallet transactions: `wallet_transactions:{user_id}:page:{page}:size:{page_size}`

2. **Cache Retrieval:**  
   Before hitting the database, the application checks Redis for the cached data.  
   - If a cache hit occurs, the JSON data is returned immediately.
   - If a cache miss occurs, the data is fetched from the database, cached in Redis, and then returned.

3. **Time-to-Live (TTL):**  
   Cached data expires after a default TTL (10 minutes) / custom TTL set for each cache store, to ensure freshness.

4. **Cache Invalidation:**  
   Whenever the underlying data changes (e.g., user updates, new transactions), the relevant cache keys are invalidated automatically to prevent stale data.

5. **Performance Impact:**  
   - Cache miss: ~124–150ms (includes DB query)  
   - Cache hit: ~50-80ms (Redis retrieval + deserialization)  

This strategy ensures low-latency responses for frequently accessed endpoints while keeping the database load minimal.

## Core Savings

### Individual Savings
- Each goal (e.g., *“Buy a bicycle”*) is a single independent saving entry.
- Funds are allocated from the user’s wallet.
- `user.locked_amount` tracks funds currently in use for savings/goals.

### Group Savings
- Groups have **2–7 members** and one or two admins.  
- Each group focuses on **one shared goal**.  
- Contributions and withdrawals appear as **chat-like transactions**.  
- Admins can enable approval for fund withdrawals.  
- Users violating group rules (e.g., unauthorized withdrawals) are **banned** from rejoining for 7 days.  
- Group balances are **derived from members’ wallets** — groups have no separate wallets.  
- Groups trigger automatic notifications for:
  - Added/removed members  
  - Contributions  
  - Target reached (50% or 100%)  

### Wallet System
- Each verified user automatically gets **one wallet**.  
- Wallet fields:
  - `total_balance`
  - `locked_amount`
  - Computed `available_balance = total_balance - locked_amount`  
- Base app currency is **EUR**, but users can select from **4 additional currencies** for frontend display.  
- Exchange rates are fetched from an external API and cached in the DB.

## Technologies & Design Decisions

| Technology | Purpose | Design Relation |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| **FastAPI** | High-performance backend & auto-generated docs | Enables clear dependency injection and modular design |
| **Pydantic** | Data validation and serialization | Supports DRY and type-safe schema sharing |
| **SQLModel + SQLAlchemy** | ORMs for PostgreSQL | Enforces consistent data access layer (Repository pattern) |
| **Alembic** | Database migrations | Streamlined schema versioning |
| **Slow-api** | Rate-limiting | For security and simplified implementation |
| **Redis** | Caching | Optimizes performance and scalability |
| **Docker** | Containerization | Simplifies setup and deployment |
| **Pytest** | Automated testing | Ensures reliability and regression safety |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD pipeline | Automates testing and deployment |

### Design Principles in Action
- **SOLID:** Dependency Injection in routers promotes modular and testable code.  
- **DRY:** Shared helpers and reusable service methods minimize duplication.  
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear flow: *Middleware → Router → Service → Repository*.  
- **Extensibility:** Notification service follows the **ABC pattern**, allowing easy integration of SMS or push services in the future.

## Closing Note

SmartSave was initially designed as a final-year project by 3 students from the `University of Zielona Gora - Computer Science & Econometrics` but advanced to a production-grade system. It's not just a financial tool but a **trustworthy digital companion** for responsible saving.  
Built with transparency, collaboration, and user privacy at its core; this project is a foundation for modern, ethical financial technology.

**Thank you for checking out SmartSave! 💚**
