## Architecture

### Monorepo & Modular Design

SmartSave uses a **modular architecture** within a **monorepo** setup.  
Each feature lives in its own module under the `modules/` directory, designed for separation of concerns and ease of scaling.

**Modules:**

- `auth` — authentication and authorization logic  
- `gdpr` — GDPR compliance and user data management  
- `user` — user profile and preferences  
- `rbac` — admin actions and access control  
- `wallet` — wallet creation and balance management  
- `savings` — individual and group savings  
- `notifications` — email-based user notifications  
- `shared` — reusable schemas and utilities

Each module contains:

```yaml
  repository.py # Database access layer
  models.py # Database models (except Auth module)
  schemas.py # Pydantic schemas
  service.py # Business logic
  helpers.py # Utility functions (optional)
```

### API & Infrastructure Highlights

- **Versioning:** `/v1/...` URL structure for all endpoints  
- **Docs:** Swagger & ReDoc available at `/v1/docs` (protected with Basic Auth)  
- **Rate Limiting:** `Per-minute/hour` restrictions per IP  
- **Redis:** Used for `caching` and fast data retrieval with reasonable TTLs + manual cache invalidation
- **Logging:** Structured `JSON logs` per request, with hashed IP addresses  
- **Makefile:** Common commands for Docker, Alembic, and Pytest  
- **Scripts:** Dev and prod startup scripts in `scripts/`  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Alembic for `DB migrations`  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflows (`ci.yml`, `cd.yml`)  
- **Environment:** `.env.example` provided for configuration variables  

**Backend System Flow:**  

```bash
  Middleware → Router → Service → Repository → Database
```

---

## Authentication

SmartSave uses a secure, stateless authentication system built with **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** and **Email-based OTP (One-Time Password)** verification.

- **Registration**: Secure onboarding with 6-digit OTP verification.
- **Security**: Account locking after failed attempts and real-time login notifications.
- **Global Logout**: Immediate token invalidation via versioning.

👉 **[Read the full Authentication breakdown here](docs/features/AUTHENTICATION.md)**

---

## Authorization

Permissions are managed through a fine-grained **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system, ensuring data integrity and user privacy.

- **Roles**: Distinct permissions for `USER`, `ADMIN`, and `SUPER_ADMIN`.
- **Integrity**: Financial data (wallets and transactions) is immutable and append-only.
- **RBAC**: Guarded endpoints using FastAPI dependency injection.

👉 **[Read the full Authorization breakdown here](docs/features/AUTHORIZATION.md)**

---

## GDPR Compliance

Privacy is a first-class citizen in SmartSave. The application is built around the core principles of the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.

- **Data Rights**: Full support for Right to Access (Encrypted PDF exports) and Right to Forget (Anonymization).
- **Log Privacy**: Irreversible hashing of IP addresses in all system logs.
- **Consent**: AI-powered features like **SaveBuddy** require explicit user consent.

👉 **[Read the full GDPR Compliance breakdown here](docs/features/GDPR.md)**

---

## Caching with Redis

To improve performance and reduce database load, we implemented **Redis caching** for frequently accessed endpoints, optimizing both latency and scalability.

👉 **[Read the full Caching breakdown here](docs/features/CACHING.md)**

---

## Core Savings

SmartSave provides a comprehensive system for individual and collaborative savings, backed by a secure virtual wallet.

- **Individual Goals**: Set personal targets and track progress.
- **Group Squads**: Save together with shared goals and real-time history.
- **Wallet Hub**: Centralized balance management with multi-currency support.

## Technologies & Design Decisions

| Technology | Purpose | Design Relation |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| **FastAPI** | High-performance backend & auto-generated docs | Enables clear dependency injection and modular design |
| **Pydantic** | Data validation and serialization | Supports DRY and type-safe schema sharing |
| **SQLModel + SQLAlchemy** | ORMs for PostgreSQL | Enforces consistent data access layer (Repository pattern) |
| **Alembic** | Database migrations | Streamlined schema versioning |
| **Slow-api** | Rate-limiting | For security and simplified implementation |
| **Redis** | Caching | Optimizes performance and scalability |
| **Docker** | Containerization | Simplifies setup and deployment |
| **Pytest** | Automated testing | Ensures reliability and regression safety |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD pipeline | Automates testing and deployment |
| **React** | Frontend | User interface and experience |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Styling | Responsive and modern design |
| **Vite** | Build tool | Fast and modern frontend development |

### Design Principles/Patterns in Action

- **SOLID:** Dependency Injection in routers promotes modular and testable code.  
- **DRY:** Shared helpers and reusable service methods minimize duplication.  
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear flow: *Middleware → Router → Service → Repository*.  
- **Extensibility:** Notification service follows the **ABC pattern**, allowing easy integration of SMS or push services in the future.
- **Factory + Registry Pattern:** The email notification system uses a combination of design patterns:
  - **Factory Pattern** (`EmailProviderFactory`): Dynamically selects the email provider (SMTP or Resend) based on configuration, enabling easy switching between providers without code changes.
  - **Registry Pattern** (`EMAIL_TEMPLATES`): Maps notification types to their corresponding templates, subjects, and context models in a centralized dictionary, making it simple to add new notification types.
  - **Strategy Pattern** (`EmailProvider` ABC): Defines a common interface for different email providers, allowing interchangeable implementations while maintaining consistent behavior.
  - This architecture ensures the notification system is flexible, maintainable, and easily extensible for new providers or notification types.

## Closing Note

SmartSave was initially designed as a final-year project by 3 students from the `University of Zielona Gora - Computer Science & Econometrics` but advanced to a production-grade system. It's not just a financial tool but a **trustworthy digital companion** for responsible saving.  
Built with transparency, collaboration, and user privacy at its core; this project is a foundation for modern, ethical financial technology.
